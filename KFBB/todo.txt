Pitch
	Fantasy Football with persistent teams and fantastical characters.  
	1v1 duels (or 2v2) simultaneous play w/ cooldowns after character movement
Short session, mobile app

Todo:
	Handle player collisions
		Detect collision
		Knock down a random player
			Push to a random unoccupied tile away from attacker
			If pushed out of bounds, destroy for now
			Later: Stationary player = more chance to stay standing

	Create BALL class
		Allow player (CHANCE) to pick it up when moving onto occupying tile
		Scatter ball when not picked up


	Coach PC - implement concept of active tile, while there is an active tile mouse move causes others to update?
	Coach PC - implement concept of click and release, and click and drag?

	Display match over when time runs out
	Occupying Actor (Player/Ball)
	
	Create Team Class
